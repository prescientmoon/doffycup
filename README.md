# Doffycup

Doffycup is a small game with the goal of introducing young children to basic programming concepts. An online version you can try for yourself can be found [here](https://doffycup.moonythm.dev).

## Tech stack

Doffycup is built using preact and typescript. The project can be built reproducibly using nix. Moreover, we also provide a nix shell for development.

### Changing dependencies

The npm dependency hash needs to be recomputed when the npm lockfile changes:

```sh
nix run .#compute-npm-dep-hash
```
